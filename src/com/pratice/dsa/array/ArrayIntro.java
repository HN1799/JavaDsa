//	elements are stored in contiguos memorey
/* x is where array is stored
 * y is the size of the array then
 * x is the location of first ele
 * x+y is th 2nd ele loc.
 * x+2y is 3rd ele loc
 * . 
 * .
 * .Array element are generally acces using indexes
 * it begans with zero
 * 
 * Advantages of contiguous memory location:
 * 1) Random Access contiguos location so O(1) 
 * 2)Cache Freindliness
 * 	Cache is the memory which is closes to cpu and ideally evertime your program
 * is accesing to within the cache. 
 * first cache then Ram is the fastest
 * 
 * processor when the acces the item then they prefect the item which is closest to that item
 * 
 * so if we are accesing the first item then next then its very liky that
 * element is there in the cache
